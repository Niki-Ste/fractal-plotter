## Fractals plotter

![image did not load](https://github.com/niki-ste/fractal-plotter/blob/main/outputs/mandelbrot.png?raw=true)

A simple app to output digital images (pngs) of fractals, intended to stay close to the maths.

The output is colour coded by the divergence speed of the complex coordinate defining the pixel.

Currently implemented: Mandelbrot and Julia.

## How to run

You could compile and use the main method, I just start it from an IDE. Outputs are saved into dedicated folder.
